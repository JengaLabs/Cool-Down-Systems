I'm Brad Frank, a programmer looking to learn and make a living.

This project is for systems I come across that allow for cool downs
in games. Their are lots of different kinds of cooldown systems and
each have their own strengths and some are just bad. Looking to find 
out what's wrong with mine and how I can improve it.
